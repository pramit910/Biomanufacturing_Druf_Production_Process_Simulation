# Biomanufacturing_Druf_Production_Process_Simulation

This is part of Master's Coursework project for Simulation Analysis - IE 7215.

The project focused on simulation of drug production process i.e. biomanufacturing.

The following files have been included:

1. Modules pertaining to custom functions for simulation analysis: SimClasses, SimFunctions, SimRNG
2. Data available which was used for bootstraping to get the underlying distribution of it.
3. Project report
4. Project presentation conveying key ideas, and insights
