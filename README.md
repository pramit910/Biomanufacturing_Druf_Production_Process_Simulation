# Biomanufacturing Drug Production Process Simulation

This is part of Master's Coursework project for Simulation Analysis - IE 7215.

The project focused on simulation of drug production process i.e. biomanufacturing.

The following files have been included:

1. Modules pertaining to custom functions for simulation analysis: SimClasses, SimFunctions, SimRNG
2. Data available which was used for bootstraping to get the underlying distribution of it.
3. Project report
4. Project presentation conveying key ideas, and insights
5. The main python script which contains the code for running the complete simulation, tracks of KPIs and metrics
6. A simplified Jackson network based simulation for the same process that aids in validating our simulation model as compared to the actual (real) process
